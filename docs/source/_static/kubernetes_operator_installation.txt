Operator Installation
=====================

It's possible to install the operator via the `Marketplace`_ with our 
custom `catalog source`_ or from `Local`_ resources. 
The most convenient and best possible integration within the 
`Operator Lifecycle Manager`_ 
is the `Marketplace`_ method. Anyway, both methods are possible.
