.. Hint:: To stupid to find a way to install the operator in the :guilabel:`argocd` namespace. 
          This must be something with the OperatorGroup? 
          This drives me crazy! 
          Before this will happen I install the operator in :guilabel:`marketplace` 
          and patch it to watch on Custom Resources in the :guilabel:`argocd` namespace.
